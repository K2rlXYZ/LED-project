# LED-project

This was a hobby project of mine, I bought some WS2812B individually adressable LEDs and wante to make them reactive to the music playing on my computer.

I did so with python, [a fork of pyaudio](https://github.com/intxcc/pyaudio_portaudio) and arduino. Python converts the audio into color amplitudes for the arduino, which controls the LEDs.
